/**
 * Locale resolution for EarnProof.
 *
 * The app ships one language today. That is exactly why this module exists:
 * the expensive part of localization is never the translation, it is the
 * hard-coded assumptions ("en", `toLocaleString()` with no argument, a
 * sentence assembled from fragments) that accumulate while there is only one
 * language and have to be unpicked later.
 *
 * Every formatting helper in `lib/i18n/format.ts` takes an explicit locale
 * that defaults to `DEFAULT_LOCALE`, so no call site ever depends on the
 * runtime's ambient locale — which differs between a developer's machine, a
 * CI runner and a user's browser, and is therefore also a source of
 * non-deterministic tests and snapshots.
